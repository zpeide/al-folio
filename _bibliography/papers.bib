 abstract = {In this work, we address the information overload issue that learners in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) face when attempting to close their knowledge gaps via the use of MOOC discussion forums.  To this end, we investigate the recommendation of one-minute-resolution video clips given the textual similarity between the clips' transcripts and MOOC discussion forum entries. We first create a large-scale dataset from Khan Academy video transcripts and their forum discussions. We then investigate the effectiveness of applying pre-trained transformers-based neural retrieval models to rank video clips in response to a forum discussion. The retrieval models are trained with supervised learning and distant supervision to effectively leverage the unlabeled data---which accounts for more than 80\% of all available data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for this task, by outperforming a standard baseline by 0.208 on the absolute change in terms of precision.},

The retrieval models are trained with supervised learning and distant supervision to effectively leverage the unlabeled data(over 80% of all data). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for this task, by outperforming baseline by 0.208 in terms of precision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic research applying pre-trained transformer-based ranking models on MOOC clip recommendation.",

    abstract = "Quality control is essential for creating extractive question answering (EQA) datasets via crowdsourcing. Aggregation across answers, i.e. word spans within passages annotated, by different crowd workers is one major focus for ensuring its quality. However, crowd workers cannot reach a consensus on a considerable portion of questions. We introduce a simple yet effective answer aggregation method that takes into account the relations among the answer, question, and context passage. We evaluate answer quality from both the view of question answering model to determine how confident the QA model is about each answer and the view of the answer verification model to determine whether the answer is correct. Then we compute aggregation scores with each answer{'}s quality and its contextual embedding produced by pre-trained language models. The experiments on a large real crowdsourced EQA dataset show that our framework outperforms baselines by around 16{\%} on precision and effectively conduct answer aggregation for extractive QA task.",
