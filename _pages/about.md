I am a Ph.D. candidate (since Nov. 2019) in the Web Information Systems group of Delft University of Technology, under the supervision of Claudia Hauff. I received my MSc degree in Computer Science from University of Science and Technology of China in June 2019. I received a BSc degree in Information Security from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. I also worked as a software engineer for 2 years in Huawei Technology and UCloud. My research is focused on question generation for online learning and how questions affect learner’s learning process and outcome.
